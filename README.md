# Collaborative Capstone Project - Budget Forecasting and Predictive Analytics

This repository was part of a collaborative capstone project for the CIS major at James Madison University. The project focused on utilizing predictive analytics to assist a county with budget forecasting and decision-making. Below are my key contributions:

- **Designed and implemented analytics and budget forecasting functionality**:  
  - Developed predictive models using regression and multivariate regression analysis to forecast budget outcomes.  
  - Built a "what-if" analysis tool that allowed users to input hypothetical budget amounts and receive predictive results. This included confidence intervals, providing a range of probable outcomes to enhance decision-making accuracy.

- **Collaborated on visualizing Monte Carlo and simulation results**:  
  - Assisted in designing clear and interactive visualizations to display probabilistic outcomes, ensuring stakeholders could easily interpret the simulation data.

- **Planned and developed reporting functionality**:  
  - Enabled the export of analytics and forecasting results in multiple formats (PDFs, CSVs, and other document types), ensuring all data could be stored and reused for future analysis.

These contributions formed the foundation of the project, addressing critical requirements set forth by Madison County for a budget forecasting and document management system.
